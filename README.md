<h1>Temperature Analyser</h1>

<p>You have been given a 2D array representing temperature readings per days for one week. Each row in the array represents a different day, and each element within each row represents a temperature reading for that day (some days have more readings than others but there is always at least one reading). You are tasked with analysing this data to implement various outputs in a Java program.
</p>

<p>Expected output is as represented in code</p>
